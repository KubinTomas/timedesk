# timedesk
First project written in asp.net.

Project is simple version of time managment program as toggle or others programs.

I just inspired with toggle as leading project, to set milestones in my learning path.

You can open project in visaul studio, and build in localhost.

I am using jquery to refresh PartialView, and not returing whole view, extending look and feel of project.
